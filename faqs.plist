		<string>Q: Could you explain service and processing fees?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>It should be noted that in all but the rarest cases, the base ticket price pays the artists&apos; fees. To provide our own in-house ticketing services, we must employ box office staff, maintain a website and the necessary equipment for those services. The reality of providing these services necessitates service charges. We are a small venue and those fees are based on the total amount of tickets we can sell to any given event, and, how many tickets are actually sold to our events.
 
Service fees differ depending on where you purchase your tickets. It is most expensive to purchase tickets in advance via our website. It is slightly less expensive to purchase tickets over the phone or in person through our Box Office, and least expensive to purchase tickets in person at the door the night of the show. You will not incur a Service or Processing Fee when you purchase your tickets at the door the night of the show. However, when you wait to buy tickets at the door, you run the risk of the show being sold out. There is never a processing fee at the door, as we do not accept credit cards for tickets purchased at the door.
Processing fees are included to cover the cost of credit card transactions. The credit card processing company charges us a percentage of the sale price. We have had to build in the Processing Fee for using a credit card to purchase tickets as we use the remainder of the ticket price (ie: the base price of the ticket) to pay the artist, and the service fee to cover our costs in providing ticketing services.
In reality, we have lower service fees than TicketMaster, Music Today, and many other Corporate ticketing companies as we are an Independent Venue that does everything &quot;in house&quot;. The Service and Processing Fees are put in place simply to help us recoup our costs in providing a convenient way for our customers to buy tickets.</string>
